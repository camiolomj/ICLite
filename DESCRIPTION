Description: ICLite performs deconvolution of bulk sequencing data using 
             the composition of a mixed cell population.  It requires log 
             ratio transformed compositional data from cellular assays 
             such as mass cytometry or other high-dimensional flow cytometry
             technologies to identify a best fit solution for a data set.  
             Genes are clustered together using the blockcluster package after
             a multistep transformation process that includes construction of 
             correlation matrix and removal of transcripts based on cutoffs
             for number and strength of interactions.  These parameters,
             as well as number of clusters assumed for the blockcluster
             package, are varied by the user to generate numerous solutions 
             which are then evaluated using a weighted scoring system.  The 
             optimal fit solution is identified based on maximization of 
             Integrated Completed Likelihood (ICL) from gene clustering and
             connectivity between gene modules and cell populations.  Package
             outputs include CSV files of the gene modules and correlation plots
             of gene module scores versus cell counts.
